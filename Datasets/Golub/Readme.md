Leukemia dataset (learning set) contains gene expression levels (3051 genes and 38 patient samples) from Golub et al. (1999). This dataset has been pre-processed: capping into floor of 100 and ceiling of 16000; filtering by exclusion of genes with max/min<=5 or max-min<=500, where max and min refer respectively to the maximum and minimum intensities for a particular gene across mRNA samples; 2-base logarithmic transformation.
